It is our policy to publicly announce security issues and fixes through the

## Pre-announcements

On a case-by-case basis, we are prepared to pre-announce security issues and 
fixes to any downstream consumer of this repository who can provide evidence 
that any security issues would have a particularly high impact on their 
services. Email [security@tawesoft.co.uk](mailto:security@tawesoft.co.uk)
to discuss this.


## Backporting fixes

Applicable security fixes will always be backported to all packages, where
possible.

Security fixes may break backwards compatibility, even between minor versions,
if necessary.


## Reporting a vulnerability

Please disclose responsibly so that we can notify the users of our software
with a fix and/or instructions, including a pre-announcement where appropriate.

**Please do not report security issues through the public issue tracker** in the 
first instance, unless the vulnerability is being actively exploited in the 
wild or is already public knowledge. Please use the option to securely
report a vulnerability through GitHub at the top of this page. Alternatively,
please email us at [security@tawesoft.co.uk](mailto:security@tawesoft.co.uk)
and if necessary we can make other arrangements with you for secure disclosure.

If you don't receive an acknowledgement of your report within 48 hours, 
and you believe that urgent action is required, then please contact us through 
any contact method listed on the
[Tawesoft website](https://www.tawesoft.co.uk/).

If we have not fixed or disclosed a vulnerability within 90 days of being 
notified, then we respect your right to disclose it publicly.
