// Package graph implements general-purpose graph algorithms.
//
// This includes some "online algorithms" for dynamic graphs i.e. algorithms
// that can efficiently give new results as a graph changes.
//
// This package does not implement any specific graph data structures: bring
// your own implementation!
//
// In general, this package is written & composed in such a way as to reduce
// runtime memory (re)allocations by encouraging the caller to reuse buffers.

// Weight represents the "cost" of a weighted edge from one vertex to another.
// Weights may be negative, except where indicated by certain algorithms.
//
// Real number (floating point) weights should be scaled to an integer range,
// for example by multiplying by some constant and rounding.
type Weight int

// Dev note: While it was tempting to make the Weight type generic, a
// word-sized int is enough. Real numbers face rounding even when converted to
// IEEE 754 floating point representation, so can also survive rounding to an
// integer representation. Similarly, if a range of integer weights exceeds
// 2^32, or a floating point representation needs a full 64 bits of precision,
// then the problem space is probably large enough that the difference between
// two almost-identical weighted paths doesn't matter.

// VertexIndex is a non-negative index that uniquely identifies each vertex
// in a graph. Vertex indexes do not have to be consecutive or sorted, may be
// sparse, and do not have to start at zero, but it may be more efficient where
// that is the case.
//
// Many algorithms in this package will have computational complexity
// proportionate to the maximum VertexIndex, and require memory proportionate
// to the maximum VertexIndex squared.
//
// The optimum assignment of a VertexIndex to each vertex is called the Minimum
// Linear Arrangement, but in the general case this is NP-Hard and even an
// approximation has quadratic complexity. You can get decent results just
// using the indexes of a generational array (see the `genarray` sibling
// package).

// Iterator is the basic interface that a graph data type must implement to be
// able to use many of the algorithms in this package.
//
// A graph can have many equivalent implementations: a data structure, perhaps
// an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix; or an algorithm. The mapping
// between this general-purpose graph interface and a given graph
// implementation is achieved through two iterator-style functions.
//
// Graphs may contain cycles, loops, be disjoint, be multigraphs, etc.
// without restriction except where noted. In general, algorithms in this
// package operate on finite graphs only.
//
// Edges are directed, but an undirected graph can always be implemented
// efficiently from a directed graph - e.g. from its adjacency matrix.
//
// The Weight method calculates a weight of the edge between source and target.
// In the case of a multigraph, multiple edges must be reduced by some
// appropriate method e.g. by picking the minimum edge weight, by calculating
// the sum of edge weights, or by the count of edges, etc. Algorithms will only
// call Weight if a directed edge already exists from the source to the target
// vertex, so it is not necessary to validate the arguments again. If the graph
// is unweighted, you can return a unit Weight of 1.
