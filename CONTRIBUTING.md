# Contributing

Open source is a gift to the commons and all contributions - bug reports,
documentation, code, etc. - are welcomed.

## Contributing Code

### Copyright

All code contributions **must** be made available under the exact same 
terms as the [LICENSE.txt](/LICENSE.txt) file (and cannot be accepted 
otherwise).

Contributors will have their name and email added to the CONTRIBUTORS file
at the start of each minor version release.

If you are contributing in the course of your employment, and your employer
is the copyright holder of your contribution (this is usually the case when
you are contributing code at work),  then please also add your employer's 
legal name, the country where that company is registered, and the year(s) 
of the contribution(s) to the AUTHORS file (please preserve alphabetical
order).

### Style guide

* Unlike most Go projects, we exclusively use spaces for indentation.
* Use British English (en-GB) for code comments and documentation, US 
  English (en-US) for identifiers and file names.
