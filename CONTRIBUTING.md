# Contributing

Open source is a gift to the commons and all contributions - bug reports,
documentation, code, etc. - are welcomed.

## Issues and bug reports

Open an issue on the
[tawesoft/golib issue tracker](https://github.com/tawesoft/golib/issues).


## Style guide

* Unlike most Go projects, we exclusively use spaces for indentation.
* Use British English (en-GB) for code comments and documentation.
* Use US  English (en-US) for identifiers and file names.


## Copyright

All documentation and code contributions **must** be made available under the 
exact same terms as the [LICENSE.txt](/LICENSE.txt) file (and cannot be
accepted otherwise).

If you are contributing in the course of your employment, and your employer
is the copyright holder of your contribution (this is usually the case when
you are contributing code at work), then please contribute using an email
address or account that credits your employer.
